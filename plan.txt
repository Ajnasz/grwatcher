=== Getting the subscription list ===

URL: https://www.google.com/reader/api/0/subscription/list?output=json

In the subscription list we can find all of the data about the
subscriptions.  It contains the id, title, categories of the feed We can
use this list to assign the unread feed counters to the feed names and
we need that list to generate the tool-tip and the context girds 


=== Getting data about unread feeds ===

URL: https://www.google.com/reader/api/0/unread-count?all=true&output=json

The unread contains only the feed id and the number of the unread items
It's enough to know how many unread feeds do we have, but we don't know
the name of these feeds. If we need to display them, we have to get the
subscription list too. see #Getting the subscription list


== Improvements ==

* Need an option to make possible to disable the 'mark all as read'
option in the status-bar context menu
