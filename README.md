# Source code of Feed Notifier extension
## Fork of Google Reader Watcher

* http://ajnasz.hu/google-reader-watcher
* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-reader-watcher/

A Firefox add-on, which regullary checks feedly to know if you have any new unread feed items.

# How to report a bug:

If you find any bugs, please try to find as much informations as possible to help to resolve it.
* First I will need your operating system (Windows 7, Ubuntu Linux, etc.) and browser version (Firefox 9.0.1).
* If you know how to reproduce, tell me the steps.

If something is just not working for you please do the following steps:
* Before you do anything the best would be if you change your home page to "about:blank". (here is an article about how you can do that: http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/How%20to%20set%20the%20home%20page)
* Close all open tabs, then restart the Firefox.
* Open the error console: Tools/Web Development/Error Console (or press Ctrl + Shift + J)
* Here select the Error button, and check that is there any error messages which mention GRW or grwatcher or Google Reader Watcher.
* Also you can check the messages tab, maybe there you can find some messages.
* If the error happens only after some specific movements (for example checking for new feeds), clear the window and do the those movements again.

You can also try to create a new profile and install only this extension. More details about how to create new profile: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_manager.
Don't change any setting, only what necessary, because maybe one of the settings causes the issue.
